abstract: Single gaze gestures (SGGs), as the basic unit of gaze gestures, interact with graphical display objects (GDOs) on a graphical user interface (GUI) through user saccades to control the system. The brightness design of the interface and saccade direction can significantly affect interaction performance and user experience. Therefore, this study adopts the method of ergonomic experiments combined with subjective evaluation, proposing the design suggestions for the background brightness (BB), brightness contrast (BC), GDO (completion field) directions, and target brightness (TB) of the gaze gesture interface:(1) Background brightness:To ensure the efficiency and experience in actual use, the background of the interface should choose a brightness value slightly lower than 50%; (2) Brightness contrast:At 25% BB, it is advisable to choose a brightness value between 21.5% and 43.5%, and the best choice is 33.25%. Under the condition of BB above 50%, the brightness contrast value of 50% can meet the requirements of the operation task; (3) Target brightness:In the gaze gesture interface design, light color should be used to mark the target; (4) GDO Directions:The GDO should be placed on the upper side of the initiation field (IF), and it is best to be directly above the IF. The contribution of this research is the proposal of an interface design strategy that is beneficial for improving the performance and experience of gaze gesture interaction and can provide future directions and recommendations for interface design.
