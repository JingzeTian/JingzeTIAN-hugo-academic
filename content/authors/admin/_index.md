Hi, I'm Jingze. I wish to be a researcher with a passion for cross-disciplinary technology development and human-computer interaction. Currently, my research interests include eye-based HCI, mixed reality, and user modeling, with a particular focus on evaluating and creating user-centered interactions to improve user efficiency and experience, as well as designing for individuals with disabilities. In the future, I hope to work on HCI design for tools, explore and practice HCI problems between humans and advanced technologies, and publish in top journals and conferences in HCI.
