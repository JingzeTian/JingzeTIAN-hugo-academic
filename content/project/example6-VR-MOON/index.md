VR_MOON is a virtual reality simulation platform that allows users to experience various tasks in the lunar base and lunar rover. We designed and developed the platform using Unity and VR Interaction Framework (VRIF), which includes other packages such as Oculus Integration, VR Builder, Final IK, and more. We used the Oculus Quest 2 to record the following videos.

My work:

- I was responsible for the design and development of the "Extravehicular Simulation" scenario.
- I contributed to the UX design.
- I also conducted some model editing and rendering work.
