## 1. Achievements:

With the guidance of Assistant Prof. Mingming Fan, I led a research team and conducted a user study aimed at improving VR accessibility for people with motor impairments, specifically those with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, using participatory design.
As the first author, my paper titled "Designing Gaze-Assisted Upper-Body Gesture Interaction with and for People with Spinal Muscular Atrophy in VR" has been submitted to CHI'24.

## 2. Timeline:

- 23/05/27-23/06/1: Interview for the HCIX project, joining APEX Lab as a Research Assistant, under the supervision of Prof. Mingming Fan.
- Inspired by a paper on User-Centered Design for individuals with upper-body motor impairments, I discussed with Prof. Mingming and proposed the Initial Research Idea: Design gaze and mid-air gestures for individuals with motor impairments to use in VR.
- 23/06/01-23/06/20: Conducted a Literature Review to understand the importance and challenges of using VR devices for individuals with motor impairments.
- 23/06/12: I organized the team with Yingna Wang, Liyi Xu, Keye Yu, and Junan Xie.
- 23/06/20-23/07/20: Developed the study protocol and discussed it with my teammates.
- 23/06/20-23/09/01: Recruited participants.
- 23/07/01-23/08/20: Designed, prepared, and conducted experiments. Due to the hardship of participant recruitment, we updated the study protocol three times.
- 23/08/05: [Dr. Franklin](https://franklin-li.com/) from CMU joined our team and provided many useful advices.
- 23/08/10-23/09/10: Analyzed the results.
- 23/08/16-23/09/15: Wrote and edited the paper.

## 3. Difficulties and Solutions:

#### Difficulty 1: Participants
To conduct research on VR Accessibility, we needed to find in-person or online participants with VR experience. However, it was challenging to recruit both types. We visited hospitals and the local community center for people with disabilities (Disability Federation). Most of the people we met were elderly and unfamiliar with computing devices. Although we found some younger individuals with motor impairments, few of them had VR experience, which was essential for our study.
  - Solution
  I continued to connect with the disability community, both online and in person. I made efforts to seek help from each person I connected with, and eventually, I reached out to [the Meier Advocacy & Support Center for SMA 美儿SMA关爱中心](http://www.meier.org.cn/), a disability advocacy organization. With their assistance, I finally recruited 12 suitable participants (2 in person and 10 online).

#### Difficulty 2: Lack of prior research on VR commands
We lacked prior research on VR commands for reference and faced the difficulty of summarizing specific VR tasks from a variety of VR applications.
  - Solution
  We dedicated significant effort to conduct video analysis of over 60 YouTube videos and applied rigorous criteria for coding.

## 4. Main Gains through the Project:

I learned a new qualitative study method: User-centered design. Additionally, through interviewing for **over 24 hours** (12 participants * 2 hours), I fully learned how to explore demands from what people are saying and how to code and analyze the thinking from interview recordings.

I obtained connections with two disability advocacy organizations, one is [the Meier Advocacy & Support Center for SMA 美儿SMA关爱中心](http://www.meier.org.cn/), and another is [Guangzhou Rare Disease Care Center 广州众援力罕见病关爱中心](https://weibo.com/748287897). The core members of these organizations encourage me to continue my research in the future. Besides, I connected with **more than 50 people** with motor impairments, most of them have SMA, and others have ASL, cerebral palsy, etc. Based on these connections, I am motivated to do some research about improving VR/AR accessibility for people with motor impairments.

Through our research, I fully participated in understanding how people with motor impairments want to interact with VR devices and found some potential research directions as well. I summarized them as follows.

## 5. Future research direction:

I raised two research ideas as the extension of the accomplished user study

1. **A context-aware interface to automatically adjust which muscle should be used**

Many people with SMA mentioned the trade-off between the sense of experience and performance:
While playing VR games, they prefer to use their stronger muscles to achieve better performance.
When relaxing (e.g., watching VR movies), they prefer to use weaker muscles for exercises.
It is essential to propose an automatic interface to help them balance the sense of experience and performance while using VR.

2. **Designing Micro-gestures for commands input**

Some people with severe SMA cannot perform wide-range movements to interact with computing devices. They wish to use micro-gestures (e.g., slight wrist swipes) for VR input. Therefore, we could model their micro-gestures or use computer vision to detect them to facilitate computer interaction.
While communicating with some people with motor impairments, I also gathered valuable research insights.

3. **A Customized Interface for Fast or Simultaneous Input**

One participant with severe motor impairments who enjoys playing computer games often combines VoiceAttack (a voice-controlled software used to input computer commands as an alternative to a keyboard) with a mouse. He also recorded how he plays computer games with this combination. However, it is challenging for him to achieve zero-delay manipulation or simultaneously press multiple keys. One solution he proposed is to create some customized keys that can trigger multiple key presses simultaneously. Other solutions could be explored in the future.

4. **Using traditional input solutions in VR**

When discussing the use of VR, more than three people with motor impairments mentioned that the most suitable VR input method for them is using a mouse and keyboard, as well as some touchscreens. Since there has been research exploring how to use a phone to manipulate in VR, I am highly motivated to conduct further research in this area in the future!

5. **Improvement of Quadstick**

There is a mouth-controlled input device named Quadstick, which is often used by many individuals with disabilities who have difficulty using their hands to interact with computers. Although it can provide sufficient performance if users are familiar with it, some users mentioned that it is too difficult to learn, especially for older individuals, and it often breaks. Therefore, it is significant to find ways to address these issues.
