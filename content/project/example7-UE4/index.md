This project builds a Sea Battle simulation platform using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

My work:
- I was responsible for the design and development of ship attack animations, scene integration, and functional integration using UE4 (Blueprint). 
- I also participated in editing the models with Blender and Cinema4D.
